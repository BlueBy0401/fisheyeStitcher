## Installation

The code is built in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (but should work fine under Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as well).

### Pre-requiste

* OpenCV 3.4.2 (with calib3d), which I built from source.
* ffmpeg `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`, which is used to combined stitched frames and playback.
* cmake ``.

### Build

* Clone the repo and go to the cloned repo.

* Build the code
```
cmake .
make
```

* Run the code with provided sample images
```
./RUN_fisheye.sh
```

Please be informed that the code doesn't include the temporal coherence control, but one can implement it using the description in [1].


## Performance

It takes around 70ms-90ms to stitch one 3840x1920 image (02 x fisheye images) from Gear360 C200 on a laptop with an Intel i7-8750H CPU + 32GB Memory. See [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u90ewqR_fHg&feature=youtu.be).
